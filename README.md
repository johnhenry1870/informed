# Informed Consent

"Informed consent is the process in which a health care provider educates a patient about the risks, benefits, and alternatives of a given procedure or intervention. The patient must be competent to make a voluntary decision about whether to undergo the procedure or intervention.  Informed consent is both an ethical and legal obligation of medical practitioners in the US and originates from the patient's right to direct what happens to their body."

"There is no Federal requirement for informed consent relating to immunization."

## VAERS 

"When evaluating data from VAERS, it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause-and-effect relationship has been established. Reports of all possible associations between vaccines and adverse events (possible side effects) are filed in VAERS. Therefore, VAERS collects data on any adverse event following vaccination, be it coincidental or truly caused by a vaccine. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event."

However this is also true:

"Vaccine manufacturers are required to report to VAERS all adverse events that come to their attention."

"Knowingly filing a false VAERS report is a violation of Federal law (18 U.S. Code ยง 1001) punishable by fine and imprisonment."
